 <td>Ada</td>
 <td>Records show a precocious young Ada offered a place in the training program of Meyers Baby Food Corporation ("Your Friend in Nanotech"). After that, no official records of Ada exist. Part of an experimental group, Ada's public education neuro-sims were replaced with training in real-time signal decryption and urban warfare.

Graduates of the experiment joined Meyers Baby Food Corp's black ops division, but Ada hacked the corporation's maincloud and learned her division was protecting the Upload Enslavement Initiative. Soon, records of Meyers' secret operations were playing on every news feed, and Ada had disappeared.

In the undersea free state of Miami Dome, Ada founded the Right Wrong Cavaliers, an elite team of combat hackers and post-punk revival band, and she led their masterful guerrilla campaign against Meyers and their shadowy GovernCorp backers.

She's pretty sure Valhalla is all some sort of computer sim, but until she can find a way out, she's playing to win.</td>

<td>Asuri</td>
<td>The villages along the Arit river on the Punjab border were proud of their guardian. Proud and more than a little scared. The Tiger was a gift from Rama, they said, though a gift rarely seen. Years might pass with only a giant paw print in the mud of the riverbank to prove that The Tiger still prowled the forests between the villages.

But when raiders from the north or soldiers from the south came to steal and oppress, the signs of The Tiger would appear -- bodies of invaders high in the trees, a would-be warlord mauled in his tent, an entire brigand camp shattered as though a typhoon had struck. And the villagers would wonder that anyone was left in the world so ignorant or so arrogant as to be heedless of their protector.

As for the The Tiger, she barely remembered being a girl. She remembered being twelve and discovering with horror that her once noble family, anointed protectors of the valley, now grew richer when outsiders came to plunder. She remembered her wicked uncle lashing her to the temple altar and conjuring the tiger spirit to devour her. And she remembered fighting - fighting so long and so hard that in the end she didn't know who had devoured whom.

In Valhalla, Asuri has claimed the Tournament as her territory, and sets upon challengers to her domain with savage fury.

<td>Azoth</td>
<td>King Azoth the Great vowed his empire would endure for all eternity. Delving into dark and ancient magic, his court sorcerer crafted seven soul stones that, when brought together, could summon Azoth from the grip of death itself to fulfill his oath.

A thousand years after his death, devoted acolytes of his forgotten empire assembled the stones. Azoth awoke, as brilliant and ruthless in battle as ever, if a little dusty. So began the first reign of the Lichlord Azoth. Only after a saga of epic heroism were the servants of light able to defeat Azoth and scatter the soul stones. The Valkyries, impressed by both Azoth's battle prowess and stick-to-itativeness, gave the lich a seat in Valhalla.

However, the vow was not forgotten. Azothian cultists gathered the soul stones again, and Azoth found himself back in Elyria. Once more, a desperate band of heroes barely defeated him. Lord Azoth the Mighty. Asothos the Terrible. Azothus the Triumphant - again and again Azoth has been summoned from Valhalla to reprise his role as the scourge of the living.

Welcome to Azoth's afterlife. He would be more than happy stay retired in Asgard, enjoying some reading, an occasional battle, and the company of his cat Dander. By the Old Law, even the most heinous curse must contain the seed of its undoing. Azoth can break the burdensome cycle through ten thousand selfless acts. He guesses if pet care counts, he might be at one.</td>
